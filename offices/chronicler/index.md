2. Make sure all required information has been submitted through the form before the deadline. You will receive an email the day after you submit the form with your deadline and other information. If you did not receive this email after 2 days, contact webminister@drachenwald.sca.org.  Information submitted to the form is copied to the chronicler automatically
