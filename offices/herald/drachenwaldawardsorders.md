{: .notice--primary}

It is the happy custom of the SCA for the Crown Rulers to recognise contributions to the kingdom with awards. They give honour to those who make our game more fulfilling by working at events and behind the scenes.  Individuals may be recognized for striving for excellence in martial combat, arts, sciences, and many other areas within the SCA.

Some awards are recognised across the Society, and are defined in the [SCA's founding documents](https://www.sca.org/resources/document-library/govdocs/). From Corpora, IV, G:

> The Crown may present Awards of Arms, the titles of Court Baron and Court Baroness, and
Grants of Arms in accordance with the laws and customs of the kingdom.


The symbols of Drachenwald’s kingdom awards are all things that the recipients can wear. From the kingdom’s early days, the award and order regalia have been jewellery and accessories.  For example, the Panache is a badge for holding feathers in your hat, the Lindquist Ring is a ring, and the Silver Guard is a wristband.

Drachenwalders have interpreted these regalia broadly and lovingly, so you may see many variations of these badges in wearer’s accessories, for every era of history, and to suit every persona.
 

Following the historic practice of medieval heralds keeping lists of who showed up to what battle and what they wore, like a sort of medieval gossip columnist/paparazzo, we now keep an online database of who has received what, and when.  The Order of Precedence (OP) records all awards given in Drachenwald, from its earliest days.  You can search it here: [Order of Precedence (OP)](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/)


The Crown decides who to recognise based on recommendations from the people of Drachenwald. You can email their Majesties, or [send a recommendation via a form online](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/recommend).

# Awards Given by the Crown of Drachenwald

## Royal Peerages	

The Royal Peers of Drachenwald receive a Patent of Arms (PoA) at Their decoronation provided the Monarch stepping down did not already have a PoA or Bestowed Peerage prior to Their coronation.

## Order of the Rose	

All Consorts of Drachenwald are inducted into the Order of the Rose upon the successful completion of their first reign, unless they are already members. 

## Landed/Territorial Baronage	

In Drachenwald, the Landed/Territorial Baronage is Granted Arms upon successful completion of their first term provided they do not already have a GoA or higher ranking accolade.

## Court Baronage

# Bestowed Peerages
The Peerage Orders are polling orders. Admission to the Peerage Orders shall be accompanied by a Patent of Arms to those recipients who do not already possess a Patent of Arms.

## The Chivalry 

The Chivalry consists of two equal parts: Knighthood and Mastery of Arms. No one may belong to both parts of the order at one time. When a member is admitted to the Chivalry by the Sovereign, the choice of which part of the order to join is made by the new member. The candidate must be considered the equal of his or her prospective peers with the basic weapons of tournament combat. To become a Knight, the candidate must swear fealty to the Crown of his or her kingdom during the knighting ceremony. Masters of Arms may choose to swear fealty, but are not required to do so.

## The Order of the Laurel 

Candidates must have attained the standard of excellence in skill and/or knowledge equal to that of his or her prospective peers in some area of the Arts or Sciences. The candidate must have applied this skill and/or knowledge for the instruction of members and service to the kingdom to an extent above and beyond that normally expected of members of the Society. Members of the Order of the Laurel may choose to swear fealty, but are not required to do so.

## The Order of the Pelican 

Candidates must have attained the standard of service to the Society or any of its branches equal to that of his or her prospective peers, which is above and beyond that normally expected of members of the Society. Members of the Order of the Pelican may choose to swear fealty, but are not required to do so.

## The Order of Defense 

Candidates must be considered the equal of his or her prospective peers with the basic weapons of rapier and/or cut-and-thrust combat. The candidate must have applied this skill and/or knowledge for the instruction of members and service to the kingdom to an extent above and beyond that normally expected of members of the Society. Members of the Order of the Defense may choose to swear fealty, but are not required to do so.



# Ordo annuli (the Order of the Ring) or the Ordo annulorum (the Order of the Rings)

The Ring is an order dedicated to excellence and example at an extraordinary level. The Order is in the gift of the Crown and, while wise monarchs seek and use the advice of their court, there is no poll of current members before an appointment is made.

When the Crown appoints someone to the Ring, the new companion’s arms are confirmed by Grant of the Crown.

The Ring comprises three orders or companies: Ordo hirundinis, Ordo cygni, and Ordo alae.

The badge of the order is ‘(Fieldless) A gemmed ring sable.’ (A ring from the side with a gem on top all black.)

## Ordo Hirundinis 

Artemidorus of Daldis, the 2nd Century Greek diviner, wrote that dreaming of a swallow was a good omen for work (and business and marriage). In classical literature and art the Swallow’s song was paired in chorus with that of the nightingale, each as beautiful as the other.

Those who labour to enable the special beauty that is Drachenwald, and thereby create beauty of their own; are brought together as Companions of Ordo hirundinis (the Company of the Swallow) because they have distinguished themselves by superior service within the Kingdom.

The badge of this order is ‘(Fieldless) A martlet volant Or’. (A flying swallow in profile, head to left, both wings visible)

## Ordo Cygni

The Roman poet Juvenal wrote, ‘rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno’: a rare bird indeed, in the world, is the black Swan.

The rare companions in Ordo cygni (the Company of the Swan) have distinguished themselves by superior achievement in scholarship, the arts and the advancement of beauty and knowledge in Drachenwald.

The badge of this order is ‘(Fieldless) A swan sable’. (A black swan standing in profile head to left with raised wings.)

## Ordo Alae 

In the lands of Drachenwald before there was a kingdom, the cavalry of Roman armies were called the ‘allies’: they fought close on the wings (alae) of their companions. Companions in Ordo alae (the Company of the Wing) have displayed superior abilities in their fields of martial activity in Drachenwald.

All Drachenwald’s practitioners of the arts of combat who show high prowess in the eyes of the Crown are united in this order, without distinction among steel fighters, armoured fighters, archers and their other companions in arms.

The badge of this order is ‘(Fieldless) A wing terminating in a hand gules sustaining a sword fesswise reversed proper’.  (A red wing ending at the right side in a hand holding a sword horizontally with the tip over the left end of the wing.)



## Orders of Merit
Drachenwald has three orders that confer an Award of Arms upon the recipient, if the receiver does not already hold one (as heralds say, ‘are armigerous’).

## Orden Des Lindquistringes  

This order was established to honor a former member of the Principality/Protectorate, Fahrquar Finley Fahrquarson (John Lindquist). It is now presented to those people who have distinguished themselves by long and extraordinary service to the Kingdom.

The badge of the order is ‘(Fieldless) A ring formed of a wingless dragon in annulo widdershins Or, maintaining in chief with all four legs and mouth a gem gules’.  (A ring formed by wingless golden dragon in a counter-clockwise direction, holding in its mouth and limbs a red gem.)

## The Order of the Panache 

The Panache is awarded to those who have distinguished themselves by long and consistent excellence in the Arts (and Sciences) and who have also constantly made their expertise available to the various members of the Kingdom.

The badge of the order is ‘(Fieldless) Issuant to chief from a torteau charged with a bezant pierced sable three feathers gules, Or and Sable’.  (A circular red-gold-black emblem, going inwards from rim to centre (red ring, gold ring, black central circle) from the top of which emerge three feathers the left one red, the centre one gold and the right one black.)

## The Order of the Silver Guard 

The Silver Guard is presented to those members who have distinguished themselves by chivalry and prowess in the arts of combat, including armoured combat, fencing, archery and thrown weapons.

The badge of this order is ‘(Tinctureless) a silver wrist-guard bearing a dragon passant coward, wings addorsed, maintaining in dexter forepaw a sword erect’.  (A silver wristguard decorated with a black dragon walking in profile head to left, wings raised, and with its tail between its legs, holding in the right hand a sword in vertical.)



# Non-Precedence Awards
The Crown can bestow awards that carry no new precedence, but bear great honour and dignity, and are cherished as such.

## The King’s Order of the Companions of Albion 

Also known as the Royal Order of the Companions of Albion, ‘the Albion’ is one of the most prestigious awards in our Kingdom. It is given for “untiring service, courtesy and devotion to the needs of others”. It is typically given just once a reign.
