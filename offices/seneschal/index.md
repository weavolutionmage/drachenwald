Welcome! 

The Seneschal office helps Drachenwald groups manage their activities.  You'll find resources for this further down on the page.  The Kingdom Seneschal also has responsibilities that range from upholding SCA and Kingdom laws, creating policies based on laws and assisting the Crown with Kingdom event administration, including Crown Tourneys. Below you'll find links to some key information across all these areas and contact information for the Kingdom and Regional Seneschals who help carry out Kingdom Seneschal work.
